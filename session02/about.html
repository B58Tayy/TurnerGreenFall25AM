            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The coral mushroom, <em>Artomyces pyxidatus</em>, is a fascinating fungus named for its striking resemblance 
               to undersea coral. Belonging to the family Auriscalpiaceae, it is commonly called the “crown-tipped coral mushroom” 
               due to the crown-like shapes at the tips of its branches.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>These mushrooms typically appear in clusters, forming pale yellow to whitish branching structures that look like coral reefs. 
               The tips of the branches are often shaped like tiny crowns. Coral mushrooms can grow up to 20 cm tall and are easy to spot 
               because of their unusual form.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>Coral mushrooms grow primarily on decaying hardwood logs, stumps, and fallen trees in temperate forests. 
               They are often found in late spring through early fall across North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. 
               Their unique shape makes them a favorite among mushroom foragers and photographers alike.</p>

            <h2>Edibility</h2>
            <p>While many species of coral mushrooms are edible, they should be consumed with caution as some species in the 
               same family can cause digestive upset. <em>Artomyces pyxidatus</em> is generally considered edible and mild in taste, 
               often used in soups, stir-fries, or sautéed with butter. However, proper identification is crucial before eating 
               wild mushrooms.</p>

            <h2>Research & Potential Benefits</h2>
            <p>Although less studied than other medicinal mushrooms, coral mushrooms are being researched for their potential 
               antimicrobial, antiviral, and neuroprotective effects. Early findings suggest possible roles in supporting 
               brain health, including reducing proteins linked with cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. 
               More scientific studies are needed to confirm these properties.</p>
